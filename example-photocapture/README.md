#  example-photo-capture


This is a simple example to demonstrate another use for anchors.
When you tap on the screen, the current frame gets recorded and then drawn in space.

Code is based on ideas from Adam Ferriss and Zach Lieberman.

Note - this was built using a nightly version of openFrameworks, specifically `of_v20170714_ios_nightly` so this may or may not work well with the current release version. Also because it's built with a nightly version it may have bugs internally as well.

Current error - app will suddenly quit at random points with no explanation, likely a memory issue but will need more debugging.
