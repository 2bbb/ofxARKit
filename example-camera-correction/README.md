#  example-camera-correction

If you happen to own a larger device, such as an iPad, you may discover the camera image to be somewhat distorted. The ARCam class should automatically correct the distortion but this example demonstrates the function to call in the event that the correction attempt failed.

This project is really more a testing ground for exploring how best to correct the camera.
